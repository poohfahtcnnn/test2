        <h1>About PM2.5</h1>
        <p>PM2.5, or particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less, is a major air pollutant that poses serious health risks. These particles are so small that they can penetrate deep into the lungs and even enter the bloodstream, leading to various health problems.</p>

        <h2>Causes of PM2.5 Pollution</h2>
        <p>The primary sources of PM2.5 pollution include vehicle emissions, industrial activities, construction sites, agricultural burning, and residential heating with solid fuels. These activities release pollutants such as sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and particulate matter into the air, contributing to the formation of PM2.5.</p>
        
        <h2>Dangers of PM2.5 Exposure</h2>
        <p>Exposure to elevated levels of PM2.5 can cause a range of health problems, including respiratory issues such as asthma, bronchitis, and reduced lung function. Long-term exposure to PM2.5 has been linked to cardiovascular diseases, lung cancer, and premature death, particularly among vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly, and individuals with pre-existing health conditions.</p>
        
        <h2>Preventive Measures</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Avoid outdoor activities during periods of high PM2.5 concentration, especially exercise or strenuous activities.</li>
            <li>Use air purifiers with HEPA filters indoors to reduce indoor PM2.5 levels.</li>
            <li>Keep windows and doors closed during periods of high outdoor pollution.</li>
            <li>Use public transportation or carpooling to reduce vehicle emissions.</li>
            <li>Support policies and initiatives aimed at reducing industrial emissions and promoting clean energy sources.</li>
